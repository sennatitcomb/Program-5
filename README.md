# Program-5
** Program: program5.cpp 
** Author: Senna Titcomb

** Description: A program that applies linked lists of signed integers.  
** The program will also count the number of prime numbers as well as be able to sort the linked list in ascending or descending order.  
** The user will be able to add integers to the linked list.  
** Input: integer value, y or n to keep entering values, d or a to choose the sort,  
** and y or n again to select whether the user wants to continue the program or not 
** Output: the request for a number, the question if the user wants to keep entering,  
** the question of what sort the user prefers, the linked list values, the amount of prime numbers,  
** and the question of whether or not the user wants to continue the game  

Extra Credit: I have done the Implement sort_descending() using a recursive Selection Sort algorithm. 

Program will print out "Please enter a number:"  
Please enter an int. 
Program will print out "Do you want another number (y or n):"  
Please enter y or n on the keyboard (Lowercase only). 
If y is entered, the program will ask for a new number. Please follow the above directions. 
If n is entered, the program will ask "Do you want to sort ascending or descending (a or d):" 
Please enter a or d on the keyboard (Lowercase only). 
If a is entered, the program will print out the sorted values in ascending order. 
If d is entered, the program will print out the sorted values in descending order. 
The program will output the number of primes in the list.  
(Negative numbers are not prime. 0 and 1 are not prime). 
The program will ask "Do you want to do this again? (y or n):". 
Please enter y or n on the keyboard (Lowercase only). If y is entered, program will start over. If n is entered, program will quit.
